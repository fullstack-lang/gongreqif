About this code.

Some files of this repo are generated by a code generator (see https://github.com/fullstack-lang/gong/go/cmd/gong).

The code are generated from code in the "go/models" package, namely from named gongstruct and enumerations

Therefore, there is no need to refactor the generated code.

That is:

- all files that starts with "zzz_"
- all files that are in the "probe" and "level1stack" package
