About this code.

Some files of this repo are generated by a code generator (see https://github.com/fullstack-lang/gong/go/cmd/gong).

The code are generated from code in the "go/models" package, namely from named gongstruct and enumerations

Therefore, there is no need to refactor the generated code.

That is:

- all files that starts with "zzz_"
- all files that are in the "probe" and "level1stack" package

To generate those files from the models, the task is

```json
		{
			"label": "01 - gong generate gongreqif",
			"type": "shell",
			"options": {
				"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/go/models"
			},
			"command": "gong",
			"group": "build",
			"args": [
				"generate",
				"--level1",
				"--skipGoModCommands"
			]
		},
```

Do no try to refactor the files in the "data" directory
